via the command: 'pip install mediapipe'   .(When this project runs is the version mediapipe 0.8.5 | version python3.7)
#### **Step 2** Clone git 
Requires enhanced library files **practice11**, folder **yoga**
#### **Step 3**: Runcode
*	Running YOGA: **yoga.py**. Will guide yoga if the posture is correct, there will be a blue check mark and count up according to the specified time,
the default time is 5 seconds. If you want to change time YOGA when the posture is correct, customize the function ***“count_time(5)”***  in **yoga.py**
